# 🌿 EcoRoute

**EcoRoute** is an intelligent route-planning platform that helps users choose the **cleanest and healthiest path** based on real-time air quality data.
Instead of only optimizing for time or distance, EcoRoute minimizes **pollution exposure** by analyzing AQI, PM2.5 levels, and predicted air quality conditions.

Built for **CodeKumbh Hackathon**.

# ✨ Features

### 🗺️ Smart Route Planning

EcoRoute calculates and compares three route options:

* **Fastest Route** – shortest travel time
* **Cleanest Route** – lowest pollution exposure
* **Balanced Route** – optimized between speed and air quality

### 📊 Pollution Exposure Analysis

For every route EcoRoute calculates:

* Average AQI
* PM2.5 concentration
* Total exposure during travel
* Health score

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community Pollution Reporting

EcoRoute enables users to **contribute real-time pollution reports** from their surroundings, helping improve the accuracy of the platform’s air quality data.

For every community submission EcoRoute records:

• Location of the report  
• Type of pollution (smoke, dust, waste burning, traffic congestion)  
• Description of the issue  
• Timestamp of the observation  

Community reports are visualized on the map to provide **additional environmental insights** and help other users avoid polluted areas.
