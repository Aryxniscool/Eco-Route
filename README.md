# 🌿 EcoRoute

**EcoRoute** is an intelligent route-planning platform that helps users choose the **cleanest and healthiest path** based on real-time air quality data.
Instead of only optimizing for time or distance, EcoRoute minimizes **pollution exposure** by analyzing AQI, PM2.5 levels, and predicted air quality conditions.

Built for **CodeKumbh Hackathon**.

# ✨ Features

### 🗺️ Smart Route Planning

EcoRoute calculates and compares three route options:

* **Fastest Route** – shortest travel time
* **Cleanest Route** – lowest pollution exposure
* **Balanced Route** – optimized between speed and air quality

---

### 🌫️ Live Air Quality Map

* Real-time AQI data from multiple IoT sensors
* Visual pollution clouds across the city
* Interactive map with AQI overlays

📸 *Map Preview*

### 📊 Pollution Exposure Analysis

For every route EcoRoute calculates:

* Average AQI
* PM2.5 concentration
* Total exposure during travel
* Health score
